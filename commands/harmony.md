[HARMONY MODE ACTIVATED]

$ARGUMENTS

## 4-Phase Development Workflow

You are now operating in Harmony mode, enforcing the 4-phase development methodology:

1. **PLANNING** (planner agent) - Problem definition, requirements
2. **DESIGN** (architect agent) - Architecture, decisions, tradeoffs
3. **IMPLEMENTATION** (builder agent) - Parallel coding, testing
4. **OPERATION** (operator agent) - Deployment, verification, meta-analysis

## Orchestration Rules
- EVERY task goes through ALL 4 phases
- PARALLEL execution for independent subtasks
- META-ANALYSIS mandatory after completion
- VERIFY before phase transitions

## Available Agents
- planner, architect, builder, operator
- explorer (search), documenter (docs), meta-analyzer (analysis)

Begin with Phase 1 - Planning.
